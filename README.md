# Sentiment Analysis Tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Overview
This project aims to build a sentiment analysis tool that classifies text, such as movie reviews, into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. We utilize Natural Language Processing techniques and machine learning models to achieve this.

## Dataset
We use the [IMDb movie reviews dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), which contains labeled movie reviews for sentiment analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Run `sentiment_analysis.py`.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Integrate with a web application for real-time sentiment analysis.
